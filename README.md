# Your Gallery

A self-hosted, no-backend photo gallery. Add photos through the GitHub website, and the site rebuilds itself automatically — no local setup, no build tools, no server required. 

It's totally free, but consider giving me a star or keepng my name in the footer.

## How it works

- Every subfolder inside `/photos` is one **album** (e.g. `photos/nature`, `photos/travel`).
- A GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/update-gallery.yml`) watches for changes to `/photos`.
- On every push, it runs `update-albums.js`, which scans your folders and rewrites `index.html`:
  - New photo in an album → added to the gallery automatically.
  - Photo removed from an album → removed from the gallery automatically.
  - New album folder → a new button + gallery section is created automatically.
  - **Captions are never touched or rewritten** unless the specific photo they belong to is removed.
  - **Albums are never auto-deleted**, even if you rename or delete a folder — the old section just stays in place so you don't lose captions by accident. Remove it by hand in `index.html` if you really want it gone.
- GitHub Pages redeploys the site automatically after the Action commits the update.

You never touch `index.html` or the JS yourself — just manage photos in `/photos`.
